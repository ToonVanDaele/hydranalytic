Description: A collection of common analytic solutions for standard
    hydrologic problems. These equations are very useful for a quick
    analysis without the need for a complex numerical modelling. Tool with
    these equations exists for free in the form of webinterfaces, Excel
    sheets, python or other software. I couldn't find an R package yet, so
    I decided to put the R code I use in an R package on github. The code
    is not thouroughly checked and the code is certainly not free of
    errors. Feel free to contribute and further extend the list of
    equations.
