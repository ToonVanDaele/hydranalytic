Description: This package contains a collection of common analytic solutions for hydrologicl equations. 
    I use these equations regulary for a quick analysis. For most of the equations tools are available for free
    in the form of webforms or excel sheets. However they don't give the required flexibility and reproducebility
    I require, I decided to put the R code I use in an R package on github. The code is not thouroughly checked and
    the code is not free of errors. I you know of a package with a similar goal, please let me know. If not, feel
    free to contribute and further extend the list of equations.
