Description: A collection of common analytic
    solutions for hydrologicl equations.  I use these equations regulary
    for a quick analysis. For most of the equations tools are available
    for free in the form of webforms or excel sheets. However they don't
    give the required flexibility and reproducebility I require, I decided
    to put the R code I use in an R package on github. The code is not
    thouroughly checked and the code is not free of errors. I you know of
    a package with a similar goal, please let me know. If not, feel free
    to contribute and further extend the list of equations.
